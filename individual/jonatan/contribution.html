					<h5>Early Visualization Prototypes</h5>
					<p>
						At a very early stage of the project I made two visualization prototypes. The purpose of these prototypes were to 
						explore different ways of visualizing the data. Even though these prototypes were not used in the final visualization, 
						they contributed to our understanding of how the data was structured and how the data should be visualized.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first prototype used d3 and dagre-d3. This prototype visualized the data by merging certain nodes that were duplicated
						(nodes which were present at more than one location in the trees). It also had zoom and pan functionality implemented. 
						A screenshot of the prototype is available at <a href="https://ivismesh.github.io/individual/jonatan/dagre/prototype_dagre_screen.jpg">ivismesh.github.io/individual/jonatan/dagre/prototype_dagre_screen.jpg</a><br>
						The working prototype is available at <a href="https://ivismesh.github.io/individual/jonatan/dagre/">https://ivismesh.github.io/individual/jonatan/dagre/</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						The second prototype used only d3 and visualized the data as separate lists, showing the search term as well as 
						all broader terms. A screenshot of this prototype is available at <a href="https://ivismesh.github.io/individual/jonatan/lists/prototype_lists_screen.jpg">ivismesh.github.io/individual/jonatan/lists/prototype_lists_screen.jpg</a><br>
