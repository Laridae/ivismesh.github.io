					<h5>Early Visualization Prototypes</h5>
					<p>
						At a very early stage of the project I made two visualization prototypes. The purpose of these prototypes were to 
						explore different ways of visualizing the data. Even though these prototypes were not used in the final visualization, 
						they contributed to our understanding of how the data was structured and how the data should be visualized.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first prototype used d3 and dagre-d3. This prototype visualized the data by merging certain nodes that were duplicated
						(nodes which were present at more than one location in the trees). It also had zoom and pan functionality implemented. 
						A screenshot of the prototype is available at <a href="https://ivismesh.github.io/individual/jonatan/dagre/prototype_dagre_screen.jpg">ivismesh.github.io/individual/jonatan/dagre/prototype_dagre_screen.jpg</a><br>
						The working prototype is available at <a href="https://ivismesh.github.io/individual/jonatan/dagre/">https://ivismesh.github.io/individual/jonatan/dagre/</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						The second prototype used only d3 and visualized the data as separate lists, showing the search term as well as 
						all broader terms. A screenshot of this prototype is available at <a href="https://ivismesh.github.io/individual/jonatan/lists/prototype_lists_screen.jpg">ivismesh.github.io/individual/jonatan/lists/prototype_lists_screen.jpg</a><br>

					<h5>First Version of Final Visualization</h5>
					<p>
						After we had decided on some of the visual structures and overall design principles I developed the first version of what would 
						evolve into our final visualization. The following is the functionality which was implemented in the first version but not 
						kept in the final version:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Every node in the path to the search term was expanded. The node representing the search term was not 
								expanded.
							</li>
							<li>
								All trees had the same color.
							</li>
						</ul>
						The following is the functionality which was implemented in the first version and was kept in the final version:
						<ul>
							<li>
								The data is represented as a horizontal tree. Going from left to right. As you go from left to right 
								the nodes represents narrower terms.
							</li>
							<li>
								The root nodes are visualized as a vertical row of rectangles. Each root node has a separate color. 
								Each root node has its text label on the left side.
							</li>
							<li>
								Nodes can be expanded and contracted by clicking on them.
							</li>
							<li>
								When searching for a term, the paths to the nodes representing that term are expanded.
							</li>
							<li>
								Nodes which can be expanded to show additional nodes are filled (have a colored fill) and have 
								the text label on the left side. All other nodes are empty (have a white fill) and have the 
								text label on the right side. The exception to this is the root nodes.
							</li>
							<li>
								The nodes which represents the search term are slightly larger than the other nodes and have a glow. 
								The color of the glow is separate from the colors of the trees.
							</li>
							<li>
								The tree can be zoomed and panned.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					
					<h5>Additional Visualization Functionality</h5>
					<p>
						The following is a list of functionality which I developed for the visualization (after the final demo), in addition to the functionality 
						stated above:
						<ul>
							<li>
								The nodes representing the search term have a bold text label. The text label of these nodes are also ofset 
								slightly in the horizontal direction in order to add some space between the label and the larger node.
							</li>
							<li>
								When you click on the text label of a node, a new search is initiated for that term.
							</li>
							<li>
								When you make a search, the "definition" panel is updated to show the definition of the search term. 
								The panel also displays a link which lets you search for that term in the pubmed database.
							</li>
							<li>
								The tree is zoomed and panned to fit on the screen when loading the page and when making a new search.
							</li>
						</ul>
